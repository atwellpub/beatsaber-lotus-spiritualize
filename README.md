# beataber-lotus-spiritualize

This is my first attempt at a BeatSaber map. 

I started with an autogenerated map using [BeatMapSynthesizer](https://github.com/wvsharber/BeatMapSynthesizer)

Then I hand edited it. So far I'm not a big fan of the map and will probably see if I can invite another mapper to clean it up for me. 

normal.dat is purely autogenerated
hard.dat is the one I've manually edited.
